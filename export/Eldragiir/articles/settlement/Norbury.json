  "content": "There is a rivalry between the towns of Norbury and Soubury which has lasted for many years. The cause of this rivalry is due to what the people think is \"ideological\" differences. The population of Norbury believe that the people of Soubury are intending to one day take the profits generated from the exportation of ore to become more wealthy. The citizens of Soubury believe that Norbury intends to one day invade them, using weapons developed from the sheer amount of metal they have, to gain access to the North-Western Run river for trade. People of Soubury believe that the citizens of Norbury are uneducated and dirty while the people of Norbury think the inverse. This hatred exists out of trickery and manipulation. The city of Greenborough imports and resells the metals and fish at a higher rate. In order to do this, Greenborough maintains a lie, through the use of altered history texts, that the towns are different ideologically whilst in truth, the two towns used to be united.\r\n[h2]Climate[/h2] Throughout the Spring to Fall period, the temperature averages between 8-10°C. During the winter, the temperature averages below 3°C. Due to the Blacksalt Mountains affecting the local atmosphere, every few weeks the temperature hikes up 3 degrees on average for 2-3 days. This event isn't understood. However, an odd smoky odour is observed during this period.\r\n[h2]Religion[/h2] Sanguinalum. The Winterraine Church of Sanguinalum is located at the centre of town. This church is the oldest known building within the village. Every 5 days, the people of Norbury gather at Winterraine to hold a service.

      "content": "Ancient forms of Orcs were present within the local area at least 500 years ago. Usually defined as tribes, the Orcs gathered in groups of 10-20. These tribes were usually nomadic travelling great distances overtime to find land that was rich in vegetation and wildlife. It is estimated that between the years 237-218 PrC, Human and Elf settlers established a trading post just south near current day Soubury. Throughout the years, the Orc tribes were forced further north in fear of the settlement to the south. Around the year 140 PrC, the Orc tribes formed together in a group to settle down. This Orc tribe was called Buryian. Over the next 100 years, the Buryian tribe developed an understanding of how to extract soft metals from the Blacksalt mountains' surface to create basic weaponry. The Buryian's contacted the Human/Elf settlement to the south in hopes of opening potential trade routes. After a few years of debate, a deal was struck. There was a road developed between the two settlements. For the next 60 years or so, the populations intermixed between locations. It was decided, in the winter of 35 PrC, to officially incorporate a name for each settlement. A small group of Orcs, Elves and Humans came together and decided to keep the Buryan name to recognize the struggles that the Orcs went through. The terms Nor and Sou were introduced for directionality purposes. Hence, Norbury and Soubury. These two villages worked in tandem for a few years. In the year 0 PoC, the cataclysm event occurred. This event affected Norbury and Soubury as the river trade route was inaccessible further towards the coast. For several years, Norbury became poorer and poorer to the point where some individuals killed for food. In 13 PrC, a representative from Greenborough travelled to both towns and learned about what happened. The government of Greenborough decided that they could take advantage of this situation for monetary gain. Over the next couple of years, representatives altered Norburian's history intending to vilify Souburians. They did this to make Greenborough the sole proprietor of products developed in Norbury. To this day, citizens of Norbury hate Souburians.",

It is not known why these two transepts seem incomplete.</div>\n\t</div>\n\n            \t\t\t\t    <div id=\"8ecf0c2db5121744f8a247aa93ab325d\" class=\"visibility-toggler\">\n    \t\t\t    <h3 class=\"section-header-heading\">\n\t\t        \t\t            Geography\n\t\t        \t\t    </h3>\n\t\t\t    <div class=\"section-payload\">Located at the base of the Blacksalt Mountains, the town is fixated on a slope allowing easy access to the mineshafts.
