      "content": "It is estimated that between the years 237-218 PrC, Human and Elf settlers, travelling from the south west portion of the Guilded Coast, established a trading post near current day Soubury. They chose this location for the ease of access to the river, as well as the commonality of fish. The Buryian's to the north contacted the Human/Elf settlement in hopes of opening potential trade routes. After a few years of debate, a deal was struck. There was a road developed between the two settlements. For the next 60 years or so, the populations intermixed between locations. It was decided, in the winter of 35 PrC, to officially incorporate a name for each settlement. A small group of Orcs, Elves and Humans came together and decided to keep the Buryan name to recognize the struggles that the Orcs went through. The terms Nor and Sou were introduced for directionality purposes. Hence, Norbury and Soubury. These two villages worked in tandem for a few years. In the year 0 PoC, the cataclysm event occurred. This event affected Norbury and Soubury as the river trade route was inaccessible further towards the coast. For several years, Soubury became poorer and poorer to the point where some individuals killed for food. In 13 PrC, a representative from Greenborough travelled to both towns and learned about what happened. The government of Greenborough decided that they could take advantage of this situation for monetary gain. Over the next couple of years, representatives altered Souburian's history intending to vilify Norburians. They did this to make Greenborough the sole proprietor of products developed in Soubury. To this day, citizens of Soubury hate Norburians.",
